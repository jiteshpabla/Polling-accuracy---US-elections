   		<strong> Topic </strong>
    	<p>Election Polls are conducted by several companies where they ask people who they are going to vote for, and some people take polling averages to predict who is going to win the election (like fivethirtyeight). The 2020 Presidential Election in the USA was heavily polled, and Joe Biden (Democrat) was projected to win in a majority of states in the USA based on the polling averages. Even though Biden won, the polls were off by a lot of percent points accordin to many people. This has caused people to doubt their trust of polling itself. So should you trust the polls or not?</p>
    	<strong> Trust the polls (Left) </strong>
    	<p></p>
    	<strong> Don't trust the polls (Right) </strong>
