   		<strong> Topic </strong>
    	<p>Election Polls are conducted by several companies where they ask people who they are going to vote for, and some people take polling averages to predict who is going to win the election (like fivethirtyeight). The 2020 Presidential Election in the USA was heavily polled, and Joe Biden (Democrat) was projected to win in a majority of states in the USA based on the polling averages. Even though Biden won, the polls were off by a lot of percent points according to many people. This has caused people to doubt their trust in polling itself. So should you trust the polls or not?</p>
    	<strong> Trust the polls (Left) </strong>
    	<p>Only 2 states were predicted incorrectly by the Polls (Florida and North Carolina), which were already pretty close to their margin or error. So Overall the polls were absolutely correct in predicting who is going to win each and every state, with only 2 inconsequential mistakes. The polls DID predict a Biden victory, which actually happened in the country as a whole. Hence, you should trust polling.</p>
    	<strong> Don't trust the polls (Right) </strong>
    	<p>Even though the polls correctly predicted the Biden victory, they were wildly off in pretty much all of the important swing states plus some others. We can see so many states with more upwards of 4-5% polling errors which are way beyond what the pollsters said their errors are going to be. At this point, it just seems the polls are just wildly guessing more so than actually predicting due to these huge error margins. Therefore, you shouldn't trust polling.</p>
